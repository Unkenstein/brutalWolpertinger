    <h1>History</h1>

 <p> It has a body comprising various animal parts - generally wings, antlers, a tail, and fangs; all attached to the body of a small mammal. The most widespread description portrays the Wolpertinger as having the head of a hare, the body of a squirrel, the antlers of a deer, and the wings and occasionally the legs of a bird.

  Stuffed "wolpertingers", composed of parts of actual stuffed animals, are often displayed in inns or sold to tourists as souvenirs in the animals' "native regions". The Deutsches Jagd- und Fischereimuseum in Munich, Germany features a permanent exhibit on the creature.
  
  It resembles other creatures from German folklore, such as the Rasselbock of the Thuringian Forest, the Dilldapp of the Alemannic region, and the Elwedritsche of the Palatinate region, which accounts describe as a chicken-like creature with antlers; additionally the American Jackalope as well as the Swedish Skvader somewhat resemble the wolpertinger. The Austrian counterpart of the wolpertinger is the raurakl.
  
  According to folklore, Wolpertingers can be found in the forests of Bavaria. Variant regional spellings of the name include Wolperdinger, Woipertingers, and Volpertinger. They are part of a larger family of horned mammals that exist throughout the Germanic regions of Europe, such as the Austrian Raurackl, which is nearly identical to the German Wolpertinger.[2] </p>

    <h1>Characteristics</h1>
<p> According to legend, the Wolpertinger is very shy. The different ways of hunting him differ regionally very clearly. A well-known hunting rule is: Wolpertinger can only be sighted by young, good-looking women if they entrust themselves to the company of a right, hearty man who knows the right places on remote forest edges at dusk under a full moon.

  Another rule says that the only way to catch him is to sprinkle salt on his tail. Also common is the method of going out on a full moon with a candle, a sack, a stick and a spade. The sack is held open by the stick and the candle is placed in front of the opening of the sack. If the wolpertinger is attracted by the candlelight, you can drive it into the sack with the help of the spade. Another method has also been handed down: one depiction describes the Wolpertinger with legs of different lengths on the right and left, so that it can only walk in a fixed direction on free-standing hills. If you manage to frighten him so that he wants to turn around and run back,
   he will inevitably fall over and can be caught quickly (see also Hanghuhn).</p>
